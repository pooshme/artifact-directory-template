Title:
AMPs: A New Lens into the Tiny World of Microbes

Abstract:
In our research last quarter, we concentrated on identifying antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences within microbial communities. Our current study broadens this scope, profiling AMPs across a diverse range of organisms. We aim to refine large datasets to contribute to microbiology improvements through advanced sequence processing techniques. We utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and leverage the extensive sequencing data in NCBI's Reference Sequence Database (Oâ€™Leary et al. (2015)) to create detailed AMP profiles for thousands of unique species and uncover new AMPs. The impact of this research is significant within the field of microbiology, offering valuable insights into how cells adapt to manage their local microbial ecosystems. The profiling of AMPs also opens up new directions for alternative solutions/therapeutics, addressing the urgent need for antibiotics that pathogens have not developed resistance against. This research adds to the foundational scientific knowledge of microbial genomics, which is impactful towards several fields like innovation in drug discovery and development.
